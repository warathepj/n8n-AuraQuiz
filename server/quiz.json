      "questionText": "What do adult butterflies primarily drink for energy from flowers?",
      "options": [
        "A) Water",
        "B) Nectar",
        "C) Sap",
        "D) Dew drops"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Adult butterflies primarily feed on nectar from flowers, which provides them with the sugar and energy they need. While they may drink water or dew for hydration, nectar is their main food source. Sap is a food source for some insects but not typically the primary one for most adult butterflies."

      "questionText": "What covers a butterfly's wings, giving them their vibrant colors and patterns?",
      "options": [
        "A) Fur",
        "B) Feathers",
        "C) Scales",
        "D) Skin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Butterfly wings are covered in thousands of tiny, overlapping scales. These scales contain pigments or are structured in a way that creates iridescent colors, giving butterflies their beautiful appearance. Fur and feathers are coverings for mammals and birds, respectively, not insects. Skin is a general term but doesn't describe the specific structures on a butterfly's wing."

      "questionText": "Before transforming into an adult butterfly, what is the worm-like larval stage called?",
      "options": [
        "A) Tadpole",
        "B) Caterpillar",
        "C) Pupa",
        "D) Larva"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The worm-like larval stage of a butterfly is specifically known as a caterpillar. Tadpole is the larval stage of frogs and toads. Pupa is the resting stage after the caterpillar, and while 'larva' is a general term for the immature form, 'caterpillar' is the precise and well-known term for butterflies."
