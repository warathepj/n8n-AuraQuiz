      "questionNumber": 1,
      "questionText": "Which subtle, high-precision effect, explained by the interaction of an electron with the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic vacuum (virtual photons), provided one of the earliest and most compelling experimental validations of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)?",
      "options": [
        "A) The Zeeman effect",
        "B) The Stark effect",
        "C) The Lamb Shift",
        "D) The Paschen-Back effect"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Lamb Shift is a tiny energy difference between the $2S_{1/2}$ and $2P_{1/2}$ states of the hydrogen atom, not predicted by Dirac's equation alone. It arises from the interaction of the electron with virtual photons in the vacuum, a direct consequence of QED's radiative corrections. The Zeeman, Stark, and Paschen-Back effects are also atomic spectroscopic phenomena, but they are explained by the interaction of atoms with external magnetic or electric fields, rather than the intrinsic quantum fluctuations of the vacuum as described by QED."

      "questionText": "A successful experimental violation of Bell's inequalities, as demonstrated by Aspect and others, primarily disproves which fundamental classical concept when applied to quantum phenomena?",
      "options": [
        "A) The universality of Planck's constant.",
        "B) The inherent randomness of quantum measurements.",
        "C) Local realism.",
        "D) The principle of superposition."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Bell's inequalities provide a quantitative test for local realism, which posits that physical properties exist objectively prior to measurement (realism) and that influences cannot travel faster than light (locality). A violation of these inequalities, as observed in experiments with entangled particles, demonstrates that at least one of these assumptions (typically locality, given the experimental setups and counterfactual definiteness) must be false in the quantum realm. Planck's constant is a fundamental constant, and quantum randomness and superposition are core principles of quantum mechanics that are not disproven but rather underpin the phenomena Bell's theorem explores."

      "questionText": "What is the physical principle in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) that describes the weakening of the strong force coupling between quarks as the energy scale of their interaction increases (or equivalently, as the distance between them decreases)?",
      "options": [
        "A) Confinement",
        "B) Chiral Symmetry Breaking",
        "C) Asymptotic Freedom",
        "D) Quark-gluon plasma formation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Asymptotic freedom is a unique property of the strong force described by QCD, where the coupling strength between quarks and gluons decreases logarithmically as the momentum transfer (energy) of their interaction increases, meaning the force becomes weaker at very short distances. This allows for perturbative calculations at high energies. Confinement is the opposite phenomenon, where the strong force increases with distance, preventing quarks from being observed freely. Chiral symmetry breaking is related to the generation of quark masses. Quark-gluon plasma formation is a state of matter where confinement is overcome at extreme conditions, not the principle describing the force's distance dependence."
